Syllable Slam Project
Enter in a word, and it will be counted for syllables and output however many it detects.  

I've based this off of the written rules for syllables.

Count the number of vowels (A,E,I,O,U) in the word.
- Add 1 every time the letter 'y' makes the sound of a vowels  
- Subtract 1 for each silent vowel  
-Subtract 1 for each diphthong or triphthong in the word
